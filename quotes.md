> another very important aspect of sleep relates to neural synaptic growth. when you learn something and you go to sleep, that's when the new synaptic connections are forming. when you are learning something new, you don't want to cram at the last minute, you want to have many short learning periods, sleep, that's helping you build that neural scaffold that helps you learn so much better.
>
> there's two ways to allow these new neurons to grow and survive. One is you get exposed to new environments. That's why travel can be so good. That's where your learning can be effective. the other way of helping these neurons to survive that's just as powerful as learning is simply to exercise. Even simple walking can be very very effective.
>
> working memory is how you keep a brief thought in mind, there's maybe four slots in working memory, as something like an octopus of attention, that reaches through those slots of working memory and makes connections between different ideas. multitasking is like taking one of those tentacles away of your working memory. you get a little stupider when you're multitasking. So that's why careful focused attention is so incredibly important, especially when you are working on something that's rather difficult.
>
> The diffuse mode, it's a lot of connections, but they are much more random in how they take place. so how do you taking something from working memory to long term memory, which is more distributed around in your brain? The best way is through practice. So if you are learning something and you practice, those pattern get deeper and deeper. And that's how you can learn something and draw it. That's why sometimes you can learn something from a professor -- you even understand it. You've had that great stroke of insight. You walk away, don't look at it for a few days, and those little metabolic vampires just suck that patten away. And you can't really remember or understand what you have learned previously. So the best way to get patterns well-embedded in your long term memory is to practice through spaced repetition. A good way to think about this is just the analogy of a wall. If you're building a brick wall and you give yourself time between layers of mortar, it can set, and you can build a solid, sturdy wall. but if you don't, it's all kind of a jumble. And it doesn't turn into a really good structure that you can actually use.
>
> Tests are the best! Test yourself on everything, all the time. The same hour spent testing as opposed to that hour spent studying, you'll learn far more by taking a test. And use flashcards. If you talk to great poets, what great ports will tell you is memorize the poem, because you'll feel the passion and the power of the poem much more deeply. Now probably the most valuable technique when you're trying to really understand something difficult is simply recall. When you're reading material on a page, you read away, and your tendency is to underline it. But it's better to write it, because you're helping to neurally encode these ideas. And when you read the page, simply look away and see what you can recall. That, as it turns out, is very powerful in building your understanding of the material in a way that other techniques, including mind-mapping and re-reading, they are not really as good as recall.
>
> So another very import aspect is simply to study judiciously with other people, or talk about what you're trying to understand with other people. Explain in a way that a 10-year-old can understand. Richard Feynman used to go around and challenge top mathematicians in the world to explain in a simple way that their grandmother can understand, they could. So this means that no matter how difficult that problem is that you're working on, if you find a way to explain it simply, you'll be able to understand it much deeply.
>
> Try to find a way to get yourself into almost like a play, whatever you're trying to understand. we're often told, follow your passion. that is the key to everything, and your life will really be a better place for it. But some things, your passion develops about what you really good at. And somethings take much longer to get good at. So don't just follow your passion. Broaden your passions. And you lives will be greatly enriched.

> if you are only focusing, you are not making access or getting access to a lot of the different connections that are available for you. That's why going back and forth between modes can be so very important.
>
> Procrastination arises in a very interesting way. Studies have shown that if you look at something you don't like, the pain centers of your brain actually activate. So if you look at a book for a subject you don't like, you can actually feel a twinge, and we can see it in the brain. you have two different ways of handling it. The first way is you can work through it, like 20 minutes or so, and the pain will gradually disappear. But if you're like most people, what you'll do is you'll just kind of turn your attention away to something more pleasant, and guess what, you'll feel better immediately, right? so in some sense, procrastination can actually be a little bit like an addiction. you do it once, you do it twice, it's not that a big deal, you do it a lot of times, though, and it actually can be very very detrimental for your life.
>
> So what I'm going to do is cut right to the chase and say here's the most effective way to help you deal with procrastination, and it is simply to use the Pomodoro Technique. Because you are only focusing on the task and the time, and not the pain of "I must complete this task" it somehow makes it so much easier to do. Don't focus on the task, focus on the time.
>
> If you look at the cells, when you're awake, these metabolites will come out, and they'll go in between the junctions, and they kind of sit out there, and they're essentially toxins in your brain. So when you're awake, these toxins are gradually accumulating in your brain. And they affect your judgement. That's why when you stay awake a longer and longer time, it's more and more difficult to think clearly. when you go to sleep, they(cells) shrink, and because they shrink, what that does is that allow fluids to wash by the cells, and wash these metabolites out.

> 我所做的每一件事都有赖于我们人类的其他成员，以及他们的贡献和成就。我们很多人都想回馈社会，在历史的长河中再添一笔。我们只能用这种大多数人都掌握的方式去表达——因为我们不会写鲍勃・迪伦的歌或汤姆・斯托帕德的戏剧。我们试图用我们仅有的天分去表达我们深层的感受，去表达我们对前人所有贡献的感激，去为历史长河加上一点儿什么。那就是推动我的力量。

> Leonardo's practiced orientation, penetrating intelligence, curiosity and independent sprint led him to question much of the accepted theory and dogma of his time.
>
> In his studies of geology, Leonardo walked the hills of Lombardy and held fossils in his hands. when he wanted to learn anatomy, he dissected more than thirty human bodies and countless animal corpses.
>
> He was in the habit of studying all classical and medieval authorities obtainable on the subjects in which he was interested.
>
> He viewed the work of others as "experience by proxy" to be studied carefully and critically and ultimately to be tested through his own experience.
>
> Learning to think like Leonardo requires the eye-opening work of questioning your own opinions, assumptions and beliefs. are your opinions and beliefs truly your own?
>
> Yet Leonardo reflected sadly that the average human "looks without seeing, listens without hearing, touches without feeling, eats without tasting, moves without physical awareness, inhales without awareness of fragrances and talks without thinking"
>
> "I have found in my own experience that it is of no small benefit when you lie in bed in the dark to go over again in the imagination of the outlines of the forms you have been studying or of other noteworthy things conceived by subtle speculation, and this is certainly a praiseworthy exercise and useful in impressing things on the memory."
>
> One of the best ways to cultivate the art of visualization is through the visualization of art. Choose any one of the masterpieces of your favorite artist - for example, Leonardo's The Last Supper or Van Gogh's Sunflowers. Hang a reproduction on your wall and study it for at least five minutes each day for a week. Then as you drift off to sleep each night aim to re-create the painting in your mind's eye. Visualize the details. Bring all your senses to this exercise.
>
> Leonardo emphasized that drawing was the foundation of painting and of learning how to see.
>
> Fine music is the most powerful toll for cultivating appreciation of sound and the subtleties of hearing.
>
> Study the science of art and the art of science.
>
> Mind mapping is an invaluable toll for simplifying complex tasks.
>
> Leonardo's incredible ability to learn and create was predicated on his cultivation of memory, what he called "learning by heart". After careful observation from multiple perspectives, Leonardo drew a visual image of his subject. Then, late at night or early in the morning, as he lay in bed. he would review and vivify the image in his mind's eye. Then he compared his mental image to his best drawing until he could hold the perfect image in his mind.
>
> He didn't need to organize them by category or create an outline, because he saw how everything connected to everything else.
>
> one secret of Leonardo's unparalleled creativity is his lifelong practice of combining and connecting disparate elements to form new patterns.
>
> Many of his inventions and designs arose from the playful, imaginary combinations he made of different natural forms.

> 由于受到第二次世界大战期间各种因素的刺激，我曾短暂地钻研过基础物理学。这次钻研极大地提高了我的智慧。结果我得到了更多的思维模式，所以我更不会成为寓言中那个‘拿着铁锤的人’。
>
> 查理选择了数学作为他的专业，因为他被数学逻辑和推理所吸引。上了一门理科必修的基础课程之后，他也喜欢上了物理学。查理为物理学的魅力和广阔的研究范围而着迷，尤其让他印象深刻的是阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦这样的物理学家研究未知事物的过程。查理后来热衷于用物理学的方式来解决问题，他认为这是处理各种生活问题的有效技巧。他常常说，任何人要想获得成功，都应该学习物理学。

> [28:40] A few things we learnd: One is constant review. The second is, it must be safe for people to tell the truth. Third is that communication should not mirror the orgnizational hierarchy. People and how they function is more important than ideas. And do not let success mask problems. Do a deep assessment.
